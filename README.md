## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Visual Studio Code editor.

This was the first project I built when I started learning about front-end web development.
I created the structure of the page with various HTML element tags such as h1, h2, p, div, img, button, etc.
I added CSS properties for style and design with background color, font, margins, borders, and more. To include a user interaction, I added JavaScript functionalities; let, if, else, prompt, event. With this, I featured a quiz that suggests to the user two plants that would suit them best based on their preference of maintenance level.

## Optimizations
<p>
  Originally when I built this landing page, it was intended for desktop viewing primarily. I later optimized the page by making it responsive and easier  to view for smaller devices.
