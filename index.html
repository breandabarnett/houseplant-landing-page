        A houseplant is a plant that is grown indoors in places such as
        residences and offices, mainly for decorative purposes, but studies have
        also shown them to have positive psychological effects. They also help
        with indoor air purification, since some species, and the soil-dwelling
        microbes associated with them, reduce indoor air pollution.
